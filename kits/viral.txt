When the WiFi drops and you suddenly notice everyone around you.
Adulting is saying “I’ll sleep early” and never actually doing it.
POV: You said you'd watch one episode and ended up finishing the season.
My bank account says no but my cart says yes.
My patience is like my WiFi signal — unstable.
When the group chat actually meets in person.
Somebody: “Why are you so quiet?” Me: Thinking about snacks.
Mood: overthinking but still vibing.
Listening to my favorite song like it owes me money.
If we’re not laughing until we cry, what are we even doing?
I’m not procrastinating, I’m creating suspense.
Me opening the fridge for the tenth time like it’s a Netflix series.
Don’t mind me, just existing in my own universe.
When the coffee hits just right.
If my sarcasm burned calories I’d be a fitness influencer.
Raise your hand if your laundry is multiplying by itself.
I came. I saw. I socially panicked.
Tell me you’re tired without telling me you’re tired.
Can we start the weekend over? I wasn’t ready.
That awkward moment when you wave back… to a stranger behind you.
Powered by caffeine and questionable decisions.
I wish calories burned themselves while I scrolled.
Remember when we thought 2024 was going to be our year?
That feeling when your playlist just understands.
Me: I need sleep. Also me: one more scroll.
Diet tip: Eat what you want and try not to cry.
When someone asks what day it is and you guess.
Sorry for the things I said when I was hungry.
Currently accepting applications for someone to bring me snacks.
Can we uninstall 2025 and reinstall it? I think something’s wrong.
